class Vector /* implements List<E>, RandomAccess */{
		// Thread Safe - Synchronized Methods
		// implements RandomAccess, a marker interface, meaning it support fast
		// almost constant time - access
}

Vector has the same operations as an ArrayList. However, all methods in Vector 
are synchronized. So, we can use Vector if we share a list between two threads 
and we would want to them synchronized.
